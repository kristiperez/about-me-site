    <p>Hi! My name is Kristi. I have an undergraduate degree in marketing and an MBA. I’ve worked in the seismic industry for most of my career, and started out in marketing communications. Over the years, I’ve moved further and further away from marketing communications and closer to market analysis/research and managing sales and marketing applications. Most recently, I was the Director of CRM and Market Intelligence for a geophysical technology company.</p>
    <p>It has taken me a long time to pinpoint what I’m good at, and the kind of work, I truly enjoy. When I look back on my career, the times I’ve been most engaged and energized, have been times when I needed to solve a problem.  A problem, I didn’t have an answer to, but with some research and resourcefulness, I was able to find a solution. And it turns out, these problems, have almost always required a technology solution. So that’s, kind of why I’m here.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Spending time with my awesome family</li>
      <li>Cooking</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Learning new things</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Oh...and I enjoy listening to music. My favorite band is <a href="https://deathcabforcutie.com/">Death Cab for Cutie.</a></p>
